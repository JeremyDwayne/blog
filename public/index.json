[{"content":"I recently tried solving a coding challenge that required concurrent processing of data. This is something I\u0026rsquo;ve honestly never done before in code. At work, almost everything is event driven, and tasks that do need to be done asynchronously or concurrently have been done through systems like Sidekiq, Redis or message queues like Kafka.\nI want to introduce the problem to you, go over my solution, and describe my thought process along the way.. as best I can. I\u0026rsquo;m in no way trying to even claim I solved the problem correctly, or used Threads and Queues in the way they\u0026rsquo;re intended. What I can do, however, is document what I did and continue to learn and grow from here.\nI found this to be incredibly engaging for me, because it was a new concept that I hadn\u0026rsquo;t attempted to write code for before.\nThe Problem A user\u0026rsquo;s identity is flagged, and they must meet with a support rep to validate they are who they say they are. Design a system that ingests the users, assigns a support rep to the case, and validates their identity.\nRequirements A new user will be added to the queue every 2 seconds An identity will be verified after 4 seconds A support rep can only work on one validation at a time. Expected Output User \u0026lt;ID\u0026gt; has been verified and removed from the queue Metrics to demonstrate the progress of the queue. Provided data users = [ { id: 1 }, { id: 2 }, { id: 3 }, { id: 4 }, { id: 5 }, { id: 6 }, { id: 7 }, { id: 8 }, { id: 9 }, { id: 10 } ] support_reps = [ { id: 1 }, { id: 2 }, { id: 3 }, { id: 4 } ] The Attempted Solution Since we\u0026rsquo;re building out a queue data structure, we can use the Queue class that Ruby provides. The alternative approach, and what I used initially, is to use an array as a basic queue.\nSomething like this technically works, but is a basic approach and isn\u0026rsquo;t as straightforward to process in parallel.\nusers = [] users.push({ id: 1}) users.shift Once I remembered there actually is a standard Queue class, I noticed that it intrinsically supports Threads. Threads are how I plan on processing multiple users simultaneously.\nclass VerificationQueue attr_reader :users, :support_reps def initialize @users = Queue.new @support_reps = [] end def verify_users workers = support_reps.size.times.map do Thread.new do begin while user = users.pop support_rep = available_support_rep if support_rep \u0026amp;\u0026amp; user support_rep.update_status(\u0026#39;busy\u0026#39;) session = VerificationSession.new(user, support_rep) self.to_s until(session.verified?) end support_rep.update_status(\u0026#39;available\u0026#39;) puts \u0026#34;User #{user[:id]} has been verified and removed from the queue\u0026#34; puts session.to_s end end rescue ThreadError end end end workers.map(\u0026amp;:join) end def available_support_rep support_reps.each do |ref| next if ref.status == \u0026#39;busy\u0026#39; return ref end end def add_user(user) users.push(user) puts \u0026#34;User #{user[:id]} added to the queue.\u0026#34; end def add_support_rep(support_rep) support_reps.push(support_rep) puts \u0026#34;support_rep #{support_rep.id} has started working.\u0026#34; end def to_s puts \u0026#34;==== Queue Status ====\u0026#34; puts \u0026#34;Users still in queue: #{users.size}\u0026#34; puts \u0026#34;support_reps\u0026#34; puts support_reps puts \u0026#34;======================\u0026#34; end I spin up a new thread for each support rep, so the code can verify the users simultaneously. When each support rep becomes available again, it picks up the next user in the queue.\nThe algorithm I used to select an available support rep isn\u0026rsquo;t elegant. It just loops through the reps and chooses the next available. If I really cared about work-life balance I would implement some sort of weighted priority system that could determine how much work each rep had taken on recently.\nThe verification process is managed through a VerificationSession. Due to the simplicity of the challenge, it just tracks the time elapsed and completes after 4 seconds. In a real implementation you would trigger whatever logic would be necessary to verify the identity of a user.\nclass VerificationSession TIME_COMPLETED = 4.0 attr_reader :user, :support_rep, :start_time def initialize(user, support_rep) @user = user @support_rep = support_rep @start_time = Process.clock_gettime(Process::CLOCK_MONOTONIC) end def elapsed_time end_time = Process.clock_gettime(Process::CLOCK_MONOTONIC) end_time - start_time end def verified? elapsed_time \u0026gt;= TIME_COMPLETED end def to_s \u0026#34;VerificationSession: User: #{user[:id]} Rep: #{support_rep} Elapsed: #{elapsed_time.round(4)}\u0026#34; end end There\u0026rsquo;s a couple of approaches we can take to build out our SupportRep objects. The first that came to mind was creating a class which would allow future expansion of functionality. The more simplistic route would be to create a Struct. What I struggle with in these coding challenges is the trade-offs between expressing good design and keeping the solution short and sweet.\nSo first is the more traditional class route that I actually wrote, followed by how I think I would approach this in the future with a Struct.\nclass SupportRep attr_reader :id, :status def initialize(id, status = \u0026#39;available\u0026#39;) @id = id @status = status end def update_status(status) @status = status end def to_s \u0026#34;id: #{id}, status: #{status}\u0026#34; end end Here\u0026rsquo;s an example of how I might do it with a Struct.\nSupportRep = Struct.new(:id, :status) queue = VerificationQueue.new for id in 1..4 do support_rep = SupportRep.new(id, \u0026#39;available\u0026#39;) queue.add_support_rep(support_rep) end # Then when I need to change the status I could just do support_rep.status = \u0026#39;busy\u0026#39; Exploring the alternate Struct method is for another time. For now let\u0026rsquo;s try to run it with the code as is using classes.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s Try To Run It! Here is some simple code to build up the data we need to run this. In order to simulate a new user being added every 2 seconds, I also am using threads to start the validation queue and then add users to it.\nusers = [ { id: 1 }, { id: 2 }, { id: 3 }, { id: 4 }, { id: 5 }, { id: 6 }, { id: 7 }, { id: 8 }, { id: 9 }, { id: 10 } ] support_reps = [ { id: 1 }, { id: 2 }, { id: 3 }, { id: 4 } ] start_time = Process.clock_gettime(Process::CLOCK_MONOTONIC) queue = VerificationQueue.new support_reps.map do |ref| support_rep = SupportRep.new(ref[:id]) queue.add_support_rep(support_rep) end threads = [] queue.add_user(users.shift) threads \u0026lt;\u0026lt; Thread.new do begin queue.verify_users rescue ThreadError end end threads \u0026lt;\u0026lt; Thread.new do begin while user = users.shift start_time = Process.clock_gettime(Process::CLOCK_MONOTONIC) until(elapsed_time(start_time) \u0026gt;= 2.0) end queue.add_user(user) end rescue ThreadError end end threads.map { |thread| thread.join(10) } queue.to_s def elapsed_time(start_time) end_time = Process.clock_gettime(Process::CLOCK_MONOTONIC) end_time - start_time end puts \u0026#34;/nElapsed Time: #{elapsed_time(start_time).round(4)}\u0026#34; The output is a bit messy, but you can get the gist of it. It processes 10 users in 19 seconds, each user taking 4 seconds. Without using threads, this would\u0026rsquo;ve taken a minimum of 40 seconds. Add more support reps and it takes even less time.\n‚ùØ ruby threads.rb support_rep 1 has started working. support_rep 2 has started working. support_rep 3 has started working. support_rep 4 has started working.

But this was a very engaging coding challenge.\nI want to do more of these exercises regularly. They introduce me to new concepts and push me to be a better engineer. All I want is to grow my skills, both technical leadership and coding.\nHopefully along the way I can improve on how I am able to articulate how I solved the problem..

I still can\u0026rsquo;t believe I\u0026rsquo;ve receieved two promotions in the past 8 months. I had intended to do a number of posts on what I was learning and the progress of my career into a staff+ role.. But I\u0026rsquo;ve already made it. So instead I\u0026rsquo;m going to talk about the last 8 months, what I\u0026rsquo;ve been up to since my last post, and what my goals are going forward.\nWhat happened? I\u0026rsquo;ve been extremely busy with my new job. I quickly became a top performer on my team and kept taking on new challenges. I\u0026rsquo;m now on a new team, and I am contributing to several high priority efforts aiming to improve our systems and engineering practices across the board.\nMy original role and how I got the first promotion I was hired as a software engineer on the tier 3 support team to provide expert knowledge and solutions for production incidents. This wasn\u0026rsquo;t my ideal role, as I wouldn\u0026rsquo;t be writing features and mostly providing operations support. But I was promised we would be creating internal tooling and that eventually coding would be a factor.\nNo system gets deployed without bugs, which is why tier 3 support teams like this exist. Some companies do a rotation within engineering, some have dedicated headcount for it like my company does.\nIn addition to the \u0026lsquo;day to day\u0026rsquo; problems cusomers experienced, I was heavily involved with every single incident that came in. From sev 4 incidents that only affected a small portion of customers, to sev 1 outages, which affected everyone. I made a concious effort to be a part of every incident, no matter how late it was, or if it was over the weekend. This insight into what issues our system has, getting to a root cause, and finding a solution, allowed me to amass a considerable amount of knowledge into the product we offer.\nIt has led to just about everyone in engineering, product and leadership coming to me with questions about how something works, or for my opinon on how to improve things. This knowledge provided visibility into who I was, and what value I bring, across the entire company. That visibility and knowledge gave me leverage to ask for my first promotion to senior software engineer back in February.\nI had felt that I was incorrectly leveled when I was hired, so pushing for the promotion to senior was a high priority for me. When a coworker of mine left the company, I felt the timing was right to make the ask, and it paid off. Leadership agreed and gave me the promotion to senior.\nWhy did I change teams? A few months passed after my promotion and things were going well. I implimented new procedures and setup communication boundaries with stakeholders, which made things more efficient for the team. We also hired some new folks and were placed under the care of a new director. The additions to the team took a lot off my plate, thus allowing me to focus on more challenging issues. So I finally was able to start planning for the internal tooling I was promised around 6 months prior.\nAfter creating some initial PRD and STOP proposals engineering leadership recognized the importance of the project and agreed to greenlight it. However, they took it up a knotch and decided I needed to have my own team to focus entirely on this project. Seemingly overnight I was swapped over to a new engineering team who were being pulled off a different project to work on my proposed project.\nI\u0026rsquo;ve been with this new team for around 2 months now, and we\u0026rsquo;re about to deploy the MVP to production in a week. I couldn\u0026rsquo;t be happier with what we have accomplished, and I am proud to work alongside talented people.\nThe coveted promotion to Staff Software Engineer Shortly after this new project started, a series of events led to my workload being increased dramatically. I was asked to fix platform wide issues and take a large role in our efforts to migrate off our current hosting platform to AWS.\nThis increase in responsibility in addition to the existing major project I was involved in prompted me to start inquiring about career advancement yet again. My intentions were only to develop a roadmap for how to move towards the promotion. What standards of work was expected, what kind of projects I need to participate in, what technical design and leadership I needed to display, etc..\nI had a few conversations about this with my engineering manager without much progress towards building such a plan. He promised to look into it, so I patiently waited. Then during a one on one meeting he said,\n\u0026ldquo;Congratulations, you\u0026rsquo;re being promoted to Staff effective immediately.\u0026rdquo;\nThe news completely came out of nowhere. I wasn\u0026rsquo;t expecting the promotion till sometime next year at the earliest, let alone a few months after my promotion to senior. So, I guess I\u0026rsquo;ve made it. This was my long term goal.\nWhat advice do I have for those seeking a promotion This probably should be its own blog post, but I\u0026rsquo;ll give you the basic strategy I used. I\u0026rsquo;m not sure if this is the way everyone should approach it, but it certainly worked for me.\nCare about your coworkers Care about the work you output Have a strong work ethic \u0026ndash; get shit done. Gain visibility through inserting yourself into key situations Make it known to leadership that you want to grow to the next level Take advantage of opportunities that are presented to you What\u0026rsquo;s next? Well.. the goal now is to become the strongest software engineer I can become. Grow my skills, grow my peers, ship solid code, and try to live up to the title bestowed apon me.\nI do feel slightly trapped because of this promotion. I don\u0026rsquo;t believe I would be able to interview at another company of similar or larger size and be leveled at staff. So my goals are to free myself of imposter syndrome yet again and be able to go anywhere.\nI like the company I work at, but I know I won\u0026rsquo;t work here forever. Being able to work without feeling trapped is quite liberating, and I wish to return to that state soon. So, I plan on leveling up myself while documenting what I can here on my blog.\n","permalink":"https://www.jeremydwayne.com/posts/two-promotions-in-8-months/","summary":"I\u0026rsquo;m probably just as shocked as you are reading that title.

Two Promotions in 8 Months"},{"content":"I Bought a House before 30! The last several years has been a bit rough for me. I had been living with my parents for many years. At first, I was taking care of my grandfather as his primary caregiver, then as I went back to college for Computer Science, and then continued after graduating as I job hunted, did freelance gigs, and got my first \u0026ldquo;real job\u0026rdquo; in industry. I didn\u0026rsquo;t have a lot of money, and my income was sporadic at best. My parents welcomed the help around the house, and I didn\u0026rsquo;t mind it. They\u0026rsquo;re approaching the retirement age and any bit I can help them makes their lives much easier.\nNow, because they\u0026rsquo;re approaching the retirement age, they decided they wanted to move to Florida. They had been talking about it for a while, but it was always a \u0026ldquo;maybe in 5 years\u0026rdquo; plan. In the middle of 2020 and the insanely rough beginnings of the Covid-19 pandemic, they decided to go through with those plans and started designing a house to retire in in Florida.\nThey bought land, signed off on all the blueprints and broke ground on construction. (this was a very long process, of which I\u0026rsquo;m very tired of hearing about and won\u0026rsquo;t bore you with the details)\nSo this left me with 2 choices. Move into an apartment either in my town or to a larger city (Seattle or Minneapolis were the top 2 on my lists), or buy my parents\u0026rsquo; home and not have to move at all. Since my job at the time was local, and I wasn\u0026rsquo;t making that bad of money for my area, I decided to stay and buy the house.\nSo, I own a home now!\nI\u0026rsquo;m slowly making upgrades and making everything a smart device or IOT where it makes sense. I highly recommend doing lights, doorbell video, and thermostat at least. In August 2020 I built a home garage gym, then promptly never used it (2022 goal is to actively use it). The next major upgrade I plan on doing will be rewiring the house with cat-6 ethernet and ubiquiti networking gear.\nI Bought a Car! I had been sharing a car with my dad since like 2012. I got better gas mileage, and he drove across the state for work, so it just worked out well for him to use my car, and I use his pickup. But, my car that used to run well, turned into a junker with 200k miles with how much he drove it every day. When my dad took a new job down in Florida, preparing for the eventual move, I decided to sell the old car and buy a new one.\nMy 2011 Chevy Impala, with 200k miles, sold for over $4k! Thank you Covid-19 used car prices. The dealerships I talked to didn\u0026rsquo;t even want to give me $1k trade-in.\nInitially I wanted a Tesla, I was dead set on getting a Model Y. But then I started hearing about corners being cut because of parts shortages, and there was a 3-4 month waiting period for production. So I decided I\u0026rsquo;d skip Tesla for now, and maybe try again the next time I\u0026rsquo;m in the market for a car.\nI still wanted to be eco-friendly and considered two routes: Hybrid vs Other Brands\u0026rsquo; Electric Vehicles; the Chevy volts of the world for example. After thinking really hard on it, I decided to skip the EV route for now and go for a hybrid. I really want to kit out my house with a Tesla Powerwall, and solarpanels (need to do research on snow and performance in Wisconsin) before I buy an EV. That way I can set up a proper charging station in the garage for the car at the same time. And I just can\u0026rsquo;t afford that now. Maybe in 5-10 years that project will be more feasible. I need to pay off my student loans first!\nI ended up going with a 2021 Toyota Venza Hybrid. I wanted a Toyota Rav 4 Hybrid, but it would\u0026rsquo;ve been 4-6 months to get one. They\u0026rsquo;re high in demand, and with the parts shortages production was only going to be delayed further. If I didn\u0026rsquo;t take the Venza offered to me, they had a buyer lined up to call right after me. I know that typically would be considered a sales tactic, but in this case I believe them. There were 4 cars I was wanting to TEST DRIVE to see if I liked the car, and they were sold before they even arrived at the dealership. I had to test drive a Venza that belonged to someone who worked at the dealership!\nI\u0026rsquo;ve had it since August, and really like it a lot. It has enough smart features that it feels like a luxury car, and it gets great gas mileage at 30-40 mpg if you drive efficiently.\nI turned 30! A few weeks after buying the Venza I celebrated my 30th birthday! My mom flew in to visit, and we went to see Shang-Chi at the movie theater. I don\u0026rsquo;t have much else to say here other than I feel old now but at least I live alone and own a house.\nI Bought a New BED!! Ok, this is the one I\u0026rsquo;m the MOST excited for because it has direct impact on everything I do (sleep is important yo). I finally replaced my mattress that has a distinct Jeremy shaped dent in it. For those curious, I went with a Saatva Classic Matress in Luxury Firm. It\u0026rsquo;s a bit stiffer than I\u0026rsquo;m used to, but after a few nights I started getting used to it.\nBut it gets better than that. I also bought the Saatva Lineal Adjustable Base, which was üíØ% worth it! I can adjust the bed how I want for watching tv and to be in a comfy position for sleeping.\nI Changed Jobs and Doubled My Income!?? That\u0026rsquo;s right, this is NOT click bait! I actually doubled my income. And you can too with this easy trick!\nGet a new job at a company that pays market value and provides benefits.\nThere\u0026rsquo;s not really a trick, just interview a lot and eventually get a higher paying job (I will talk about interviewing tips in another post sometime). I went from being severely underpaid without any benefits to being properly compensated with a great salary and actual benefits. It just happened to be over double what I was making previously.\nThis is partially thanks to the Great Resignation that came with Covid-19. Senior software engineers across the industry left their jobs due to Covid-19 and burnout. This caused a HUGE increase in companies trying to hire software engineers, which led to big bumps in base pay due to the shortage of experienced SE\u0026rsquo;s on the market. If you\u0026rsquo;re making less than 100k-200k (depending on experience) anywhere in the country as a software engineer, leave your job and find a new one.\nTo give you an example of the market need. Every single day I would get a message from 5-10 different recruiters trying to get me. Most of them were also recruiting for roles at multiple companies. Without any of my profiles being set to looking for work. I was \u0026ldquo;off the market\u0026rdquo; and getting SPAMMED, by small and large well known companies trying to hire senior\u0026rsquo;ish level SE\u0026rsquo;s.\nI accepted an offer from a fintech infrastructure startup that\u0026rsquo;s well known in the industry. For now, I won\u0026rsquo;t name them, but I really am enjoying working there and will hapily talk to people about it in private if you\u0026rsquo;re interested. I moved from a \u0026ldquo;startup\u0026rdquo; with 17 employees, to one with over 300 employees. Boy what a difference!\nThere are a few things that this gave me:\nI\u0026rsquo;m finally working at a company that does its best to follow industry standards and best practices. This is teaching me skills I\u0026rsquo;ve been begging to develop for years but never worked at a place large enough. I learned that money isn\u0026rsquo;t everything, but when you\u0026rsquo;re paid under the market rate, you feel like you\u0026rsquo;re not valued, and the quality of my work suffered. Being properly compensated has made me feel confident in my abilities and that I belong in this industry. I look forward to logging in for work every day. I\u0026rsquo;m happier. I\u0026rsquo;m not stressed about money, if I have health insurance still, or if I\u0026rsquo;ll get my next paycheck on time. I like the people I work with, I respect them, and I am learning from them. I want to grow my career down the Individual Contributor path and land in a staff/principal software engineer role someday. Before I thought management might be the right route, but now I know I just want to be a solid engineer. I have a long ways to go, and plenty of time to get there. I went from thinking I was senior level at a small startup to realizing I\u0026rsquo;m still probably considered mid-level. But that\u0026rsquo;s ok, it just means I have more room to grow.\nI have renewed excitement for growing my skills again. Which is why I\u0026rsquo;m starting to blog again.\nLast time I got hung up on the blog infrastructure so this time it\u0026rsquo;s just a simple Hugo blog, with a pre-made theme, hosted on Netlify. I\u0026rsquo;m done with the Digital Ocean Droplet VPS, self-managed, and not optomized websites. I went with static site generator like Hugo because I dont need a CMS like WordPress. I was overthinking the setup and got turned off on actually writing the content.\nExpect lots of posts to come about the things I\u0026rsquo;m learning. I\u0026rsquo;m still trying to determine a posting schedule that works for me, but for now we\u0026rsquo;ll see you soon!\nCheers, Jeremy\n","permalink":"https://www.jeremydwayne.com/posts/how-i-doubled-my-income-and-2021-year-review/","summary":"I Bought a House before 30!

Running VS Code through Remote SSH. This setup allows you to use tools that require the full scope of the project‚Äôs files.\nYou can now access all of the Git tools/extensions vs code has instead of doing it through the web interface. Robust extensions like PHP Intelephense work completely. We can start writing and running automated testing suites with tools like phpunit/selenium etc.. The biggest takeaway that I got from this switch, is that it feels like I‚Äôm working in a local dev environment again. Which makes me very happy. The following guide was written for my co-workers, but I decided to strip out specifics to share on the blog.\nRequired Extensions: Name: Remote ‚Äì SSH\nDescription: Open any folder on a remote machine using SSH and take advantage of VS Code‚Äôs full feature set. VS Marketplace Link: https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-ssh Name: Remote ‚Äì SSH: Editing Configuration Files\nDescription: Edit SSH configuration files VS Marketplace Link: https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-ssh-edit Recommended Extensions For PHP Testing:\nIgnore if you don‚Äôt write php\nName: PHPUnit\nDescription: Run PHPUnit tests from VSCode. VS Marketplace Link: https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=emallin.phpunit Name: PHPUnit Watcher\nDescription: Run PHPUnit on file changes VS Marketplace Link: https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=HerisIT.phpunit-watcher\nSteps for Setup Generate an SSH Key on your local machine. Follow the steps there for checking existing keys, generating a new key, adding it to the SSH Agent, and copying it to github. https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/connecting-to-github-with-ssh Add the SSH Key to the server. You should have an account on the server, if you aren‚Äôt sure, speak to your server administrator. The FTP account used in FTP-Simple should work for ssh as well However, currently you probably only have password access. You will need that password! run the command ssh-copy-id @ This will prompt you for your password, enter it. You should be able to SSH to the server without a password now! test this by doing ssh @, if it doesn‚Äôt prompt for a password you‚Äôre set. In VS Code, with the Remote SSH extension installed, bring up your command pallette (ctrl/cmd + shift + p) type in Remote-SSH and open configuration file, this should be at ~/.ssh/config or somewhere similar enter the following config, replacing the values with your own. Host \u0026lt;devsite\u0026gt; User \u0026lt;ssh account\u0026gt; HostName \u0026lt;devsite url\u0026gt; Port 22 In VS Code, with the Remote SSH extension installed, bring up your command pallette (ctrl/cmd + shift + p) This time you‚Äôre going to type Remote-SSH and select connect to host Select the Host you created in the ssh config You should now be connecting to the server over SSH. Extensions may need to be reinstalled on the SSH host, I know I did I believe its due to them installing various dependencies to run. I also recommend opening your remote project directory, then saving the workspace locally on your computer. Then when you open vs code you can instantly go to that folder on the server in the future with ease. Saving on the server was causing me issues. Conclusion I hope this helps someone get away from the clutches of FTP! I‚Äôve been struggling with how to work remotely ever since I joined my company almost 2 years ago. This is finally the best dev environment I‚Äôve come up with and am happy about. It feels like I‚Äôm working locally again!\nI‚Äôm sure this guide will need many tweaks and adjustments. If you have an issues, feel free to reach out for help. If you‚Äôre not a co-worker, join the discord server, DM on twitter, or email me through the contact form and I‚Äôll try to help. I wrote this largely off memory of what I did, and I‚Äôm sure I missed a few things.\nAlways strive to make your development environment work for you, and make your life more convenient. If you ever catch yourself frustrated, think about how to solve it. Don‚Äôt push it off because you don‚Äôt have time to look into it.\nCommands to run on the server These commands are really just for my coworkers.

The first games I remember playing were Tetris on the original black and white gameboy, DOS computer games like Crystal Cave, Brick Breaker, and Jazz Jackrabbit, and the early NES games like mario bro‚Äôs and duck hunt. My whole life I played games till I beat them, then moved on. This is a relatively healthy relationship with games. But then a new genre came to my attention, MMORPG (Massively Multiplayer Online Role-Playing Game).\nThese are the social games that suck away your life force till you bleed dry. They‚Äôre created intentionally to get you to play longer, to use their paid services, to create relationships with friends and rivals, to join the Horde or Alliance against each other as one body. It‚Äôs not a new concept that these games are highly addicting. I‚Äôve been playing them since 2005, and I‚Äôve finally said enough.\nRunescape My first MMORPG was Runescape. I started playing the game because a friend of mine convinced me to try it. Very quickly, I became hooked. From grinding all of my skills to reach quest requirements to logging on every couple of hours to do farm runs. I spent hundreds of hours killing the same monsters in hopes to get the super rare drops. I believe I had over 400 days of game time logged when I finally quit the game after 12 years. There‚Äôs another side to that story, my youtube career, which I can touch on another time.\nRunescape was my life. All of my friends played that game, which slowly changed to all of my friends were only met online through that game. I slowly lost contact with everyone who lived near me who wasn‚Äôt playing runescape. I‚Äôm still friends and talk to most of the people I met through gaming. I even was the best man at one of their wedding‚Äôs a couple years ago.\nBut, when you stop doing an activity that takes up all of your free time.. you fill it with something else. Which is when I was introduced to World of Warcraft.\nWorld of Warcraft WoW is arguably the largest, most popular MMORPG. Its been around as long as Runescape, but easily has over 5 times the player base across the globe. I started playing wow at the end of Cataclysm, but really my addiction started in Mists of Pandaria in 2012. I was introduced to progression raiding, and have been hooked on that competition since then.\nThere‚Äôs nothing quite like the feeling of working together with a large group of people to clear a raid for the first time. Coming up with strategies, analyzing your gameplay to improve pull after pull, picking up tips from watching other people play on stream or in videos, etc.. its an ecosystem of competition, and I ate it up. I never got to play at any insane level, I peaked at US 37th, and was often in the top 100 players of my class. But the rush is the same regardless of when you get there. Working as a team to fix each small issue till the fight finally clicks and you get the kill. The ferocious war cry of nerd screams is something you just dont experience in any other atmosphere.\nIts wonderful, until it isn‚Äôt. About 2 years ago I joined a guild that I had looked up to for years. They were often one of the top guilds on my server and had a few big name streamers. It was also the start of my anxiety. I would over analyze everything that people said directly about me. Anything indirect would automatically be assumed to be about me. My brain was convinced that I was trash at the game. I pushed so hard to improve and become an expert at my class, but the thoughts still were there. ‚ÄúWhy did this loot get assigned to that person instead of me when its a bigger upgrade for me? They must be thinking about kicking me off the team‚Äù.\nPeople in my guild would rarely respond to me. Anytime I would post a suggestion, an opinion, or even joke, they would be met with opposition or simply ignored. I can genuinely say that I only ever had 2 friends in that guild, the rest I still have no clue if they like me or not. This fed into my anxiety and the idea that I didn‚Äôt belong there.\nThis anxiety, and a desire to focus on my career as a software engineer, made me consider quitting the game for a very long time. In DM‚Äôs with these friends I talked about how I wanted to step away from the game. What prevented me from biting the bullet came down to a few factors. 1. I didn‚Äôt want to leave my team without an adequate replacement for me. 2. I just didn‚Äôt quite have a reason to throw away all of my experience and status as a raider at this level yet. When you stop raiding for any amount of time, it is INCREDIBLY hard to get back into it at the same level. You typically have to slum around and work your way back up unless you have connections.\nNothing lasts forever. On December 20th, 2020, I was informed I would no longer be on the raid team of my guild. I was welcomed to stay as a friends and family member, but I would not be in on any fight. I raided for progression, farm doesn‚Äôt bring the same challenges that make it fun. My anxiety and paranoia believes there were some politics that went into that decision, but I will never truly know if that‚Äôs accurate.\nWhen I was given the news, I had a few initial reactions.\nBetrayal: this was the team I‚Äôve been with for 2 years. They discounted all of that time and my experience because I had a rough week where I performed poorly. Self-doubt: This was confirmation that my skill level, I was so anxious about, was actually bad, and this wasn‚Äôt just in my head. Anger: Mad that the people who made the decision weren‚Äôt delivering the news. Mad that I was silently being pushed away off the team. Hurt that no one cared that I was removed from the team except 2-3 people. Relief: I finally had a reason to quit the game. I responded to the news with my final feedback and advice for the leadership team. The overall gist of it was they need to fix their communication. I posted my farewell to the team in the guild discord channel, cancelled my wow subscription, and uninstalled the game. WoW has been removed from my life after 8 years, and thousands of hours of gametime played. How am I doing now? Its been a few days now, and I‚Äôm writing this post as a way to decompress my thoughts. A personal therapy session. In that time I‚Äôve been able to get quite a lot done. I finally got around to doing some workshop upgrades, and was incredibly productive at work. I feel free to do whatever I want to do.\nI‚Äôm no longer tied down to a Mon-Wed, 7:45-11:30pm raid schedule, with 20 hours of maintenance chores every week. No longer plagued by a constant thought that I need to analyze my gameplay again to see where I could improve. Relief is an understatement of what I‚Äôve felt these past days.\nI talked to a friend today and he said I genuinely sounded happier/more upbeat than I have in a long time. I dont know if what I‚Äôm feeling is happiness, but I definitely feel great. My stress and anxiety have subsided, and I‚Äôm hopeful for the opportunities this will allow me to do.\nWhat‚Äôs my advice? So, I‚Äôve quit MMORPGs. I do no plan on playing another one any time soon. I highly recommend evaluating what you gain by playing the game like I did. WoW became a job I wasn‚Äôt paid to play. I clocked in and out on a set schedule that brought me no joy. I stopped experiencing the nerd cries and instead would sigh in relief that we finally finished. It wasn‚Äôt happiness, it was the end of a work day.\nIf you feel that way, try to remember what made the game fun for you and only do that thing. For me, there was nothing left that was fun. And there‚Äôs no point in playing a game, if you‚Äôre not having fun.\nGood luck my dudes,\nJeremy\nUpdate 2021: I started playing Runescape again.. but only casually. It\u0026rsquo;s been pretty healthy so far and I only play when I have time and while I\u0026rsquo;m having fun.\n","permalink":"https://www.jeremydwayne.com/posts/why-i-decided-to-quit-mmorpg-games/","summary":"My Experience With Gaming Addiction I‚Äôve been a gamer my entire life, like most millennials.

I even made a blog post about it, which you can‚Äôt find anymore. But, I had everything running perfectly and was productive in my work. Then I gave up on it due to the inconvenience of needing to boot back into windows constantly.\nA Hackintosh is a regular pc with macOS installed on it. It‚Äôs a rather finicky process that requires getting drivers and kexts for your specific hardware.\nOpenCore Now there is a new kid on the block of bootloaders, and it‚Äôs called OpenCore. The experience I had while setting up my install drive this time around was extremely straightforward and easy. Pair this with the community around AMD, and I have the most stable hack I‚Äôve ever used.\nWhy did I do this? Well, I have to do some ios app development for work, and you kind of need a mac for that! Other than that I probably wont be using it for like 99% of the work I do. And here‚Äôs why: I can get a lot done on windows between vscode and WSL.\nWhy do so many developers prefer MacOS? The main reason why macOS is so popular in the programming community is that its unix based at its core. Unix is basically the original Operating System that was created at Bell Labs back in the ‚Äô70s. Since then operating systems like Linux and macOS/OSX have been created based on unix. Unix OS Tree\nThe reason this history lesson is important is because the terminals between linux and macOS are basically the same. They share almost all of the same tools because they‚Äôre both capable of running the same bash shell software. Most developers need to use a terminal at some point in their workflow. Common uses include managing git versioning, compiling an application, or using vim for their text editor environment.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s Aesthetically pleasing While you can do this terminal work on both mac and linux, many opt for the mac because of aesthetics. They may have other apple devices that can communicate, and a vast selection of macOS applications available to them.\nI kind of care about the desktop apps on macos for productivity, but otherwise I‚Äôm impartial between macos and linux. When I run linux, I always choose pop!_OS these days, and I highly recommend it as your distro of choice! It‚Äôs an Ubuntu based distro maintained by System76, a company that specializes in creating open-sourced systems for the STEM community.\nAnyways, this is all just an update on what I‚Äôm using for my OS these days. I primarily work in Windows through vscode. I use the vim extension and do things in the WSL when I need to. . I‚Äôll do another post in the future going over my actual dev environment in detail.\nDo any of you also use a hackintosh? What has been your experience with it, and has that evolved over the years as support strengthens?\nUpdate 2021: I no longer use a hackintosh due to the M1 chipset coming and the bleak outlook for the hackintosh community\u0026rsquo;s longevity\n","permalink":"https://www.jeremydwayne.com/posts/the-rebirth-of-a-hackintosh-dev-environment/","summary":"My History A few years back I went all-in on a setting up a Hackintosh pc.
