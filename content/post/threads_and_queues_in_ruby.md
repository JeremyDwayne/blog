I recently tried solving a coding challenge that required concurrent processing of data.
This is something I've honestly never done before in code. At work, almost everything is event driven, and tasks that do
need to be done asynchronously or concurrently have been done through systems like Sidekiq, Redis or message queues like Kafka.

I want to introduce the problem to you, go over my solution, and describe my thought process along the way.. as best I can.
I'm in no way trying to even claim I solved the problem correctly, or used Threads and Queues in the way they're intended.
What I can do, however, is document what I did and continue to learn and grow from here.

I found this to be incredibly engaging for me, because it was a new concept that I hadn't attempted to write code for before.

## The Problem

A user's identity is flagged, and they must meet with a support rep to validate they are who they say they are.
Design a system that ingests the users, assigns a support rep to the case, and validates their identity.

### Requirements

1. A new user will be added to the queue every 2 seconds
2. An identity will be verified after 4 seconds
3. A support rep can only work on one validation at a time.

### Expected Output

1. `User <ID> has been verified and removed from the queue`
2. Metrics to demonstrate the progress of the queue.

### Provided data

```ruby
users = [
  { id: 1 },
  { id: 2 },
  { id: 3 },
  { id: 4 },
  { id: 5 },
  { id: 6 },
  { id: 7 },
  { id: 8 },
  { id: 9 },
  { id: 10 }
]

support_reps = [
  { id: 1 },
  { id: 2 },
  { id: 3 },
  { id: 4 }
]
```

## The Attempted Solution

Since we're building out a queue data structure, we can use the Queue class that Ruby provides.
The alternative approach, and what I used initially, is to use an array as a basic queue.

Something like this technically works, but is a basic approach and isn't as straightforward to process in parallel.

```ruby
users = []
users.push({ id: 1})
users.shift
```

Once I remembered there actually is a standard Queue class, I noticed that it intrinsically supports Threads.
Threads are how I plan on processing multiple users simultaneously.

```ruby
class VerificationQueue
  attr_reader :users, :support_reps

  def initialize
    @users = Queue.new
    @support_reps = []
  end

  def verify_users
    workers = support_reps.size.times.map do
      Thread.new do
        begin
          while user = users.pop
            support_rep = available_support_rep
            if support_rep && user
              support_rep.update_status('busy')
              session = VerificationSession.new(user, support_rep)
              self.to_s
              until(session.verified?)
              end
              support_rep.update_status('available')
              puts "User #{user[:id]} has been verified and removed from the queue"
              puts session.to_s
            end
          end
        rescue ThreadError
        end
      end
    end

    workers.map(&:join)
  end

  def available_support_rep
    support_reps.each do |ref|
      next if ref.status == 'busy'
      return ref
    end
  end

  def add_user(user)
    users.push(user)
    puts "User #{user[:id]} added to the queue."
  end

  def add_support_rep(support_rep)
    support_reps.push(support_rep)
    puts "support_rep #{support_rep.id} has started working."
  end

  def to_s
    puts "==== Queue Status ===="
    puts "Users still in queue: #{users.size}"
    puts "support_reps"
    puts support_reps
    puts "======================"
end
```

I spin up a new thread for each support rep, so the code can verify the users simultaneously. When each support rep
becomes available again, it picks up the next user in the queue.

The algorithm I used to select an available support rep isn't elegant. It just loops through the reps and chooses the
next available. If I really cared about work-life balance I would implement some sort of weighted priority system that
could determine how much work each rep had taken on recently.

The verification process is managed through a VerificationSession. Due to the simplicity of the challenge, it just
tracks the time elapsed and completes after 4 seconds. In a real implementation you would trigger whatever logic would
be necessary to verify the identity of a user.

```ruby
class VerificationSession
  TIME_COMPLETED = 4.0

  attr_reader :user, :support_rep, :start_time

  def initialize(user, support_rep)
    @user = user
    @support_rep = support_rep
    @start_time = Process.clock_gettime(Process::CLOCK_MONOTONIC)
  end

  def elapsed_time
    end_time = Process.clock_gettime(Process::CLOCK_MONOTONIC)
    end_time - start_time
  end

  def verified?
    elapsed_time >= TIME_COMPLETED
  end

  def to_s
    "VerificationSession: User: #{user[:id]} Rep: #{support_rep} Elapsed: #{elapsed_time.round(4)}"
  end
end
```

There's a couple of approaches we can take to build out our SupportRep objects. The first that came to mind was creating a class
which would allow future expansion of functionality. The more simplistic route would be to create a Struct. What I
struggle with in these coding challenges is the trade-offs between expressing good design and keeping the solution short
and sweet.

So first is the more traditional class route that I actually wrote, followed by how I think I would approach this in the
future with a Struct.

```ruby
class SupportRep
  attr_reader :id, :status

  def initialize(id, status = 'available')
    @id = id
    @status = status
  end

  def update_status(status)
    @status = status
  end

  def to_s
    "id: #{id}, status: #{status}"
  end
end
```

Here's an example of how I might do it with a Struct.

```ruby
SupportRep = Struct.new(:id, :status)

queue = VerificationQueue.new

for id in 1..4 do
  support_rep = SupportRep.new(id, 'available')
  queue.add_support_rep(support_rep)
end

# Then when I need to change the status I could just do
support_rep.status = 'busy'
```

Exploring the alternate Struct method is for another time. For now let's try to run it with the code as is using classes.

### Let's Try To Run It!

Here is some simple code to build up the data we need to run this. In order to simulate a new user being added every 2
seconds, I also am using threads to start the validation queue and then add users to it.

```ruby
users = [
  { id: 1 },
  { id: 2 },
  { id: 3 },
  { id: 4 },
  { id: 5 },
  { id: 6 },
  { id: 7 },
  { id: 8 },
  { id: 9 },
  { id: 10 }
]

support_reps = [
  { id: 1 },
  { id: 2 },
  { id: 3 },
  { id: 4 }
]

start_time = Process.clock_gettime(Process::CLOCK_MONOTONIC)
queue = VerificationQueue.new

support_reps.map do |ref|
  support_rep = SupportRep.new(ref[:id])
  queue.add_support_rep(support_rep)
end

threads = []

queue.add_user(users.shift)

threads << Thread.new do
  begin
    queue.verify_users
  rescue ThreadError
  end
end

threads << Thread.new do
  begin
    while user = users.shift
      start_time = Process.clock_gettime(Process::CLOCK_MONOTONIC)
      until(elapsed_time(start_time) >= 2.0)
      end
      queue.add_user(user)
    end
  rescue ThreadError
  end
end

threads.map { |thread| thread.join(10) }
queue.to_s


def elapsed_time(start_time)
  end_time = Process.clock_gettime(Process::CLOCK_MONOTONIC)
  end_time - start_time
end
puts "/nElapsed Time: #{elapsed_time(start_time).round(4)}"
```

The output is a bit messy, but you can get the gist of it. It processes 10 users in 19 seconds, each user taking 4
seconds. Without using threads, this would've taken a minimum of 40 seconds. Add more support reps and it takes even
less time.

## Recap

Threads are still something I'm learning how to best utilize. But this was a very engaging coding challenge.

I want to do more of these exercises regularly. They introduce me to new concepts and push me to be a better engineer.
All I want is to grow my skills, both technical leadership and coding.

Hopefully along the way I can improve on how I am able to articulate how I solved the problem.. This blog post is a
mess, but its better than never posting anything.

Happy New Year, and I wish you all the best in 2023.
