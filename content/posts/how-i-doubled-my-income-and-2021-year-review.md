## I Bought a House!

## I Bought a Car!

## I Changed Jobs and Doubled My Income!??
That's right, this is NOT click bait! I actually doubled my income. And you can too with this easy magic trick! 

*Get a new job at a company with funding that pays market value and provides benefits.*

Seriously, I went from being underpaid to finally being properly compensated with a great salary and actual benefits that extend past "You'll feel good for contributing".

## I Bought a New BED!!
Ok, this is the one I'm the MOST excited for. I finally replaced my mattress that has a distinct Jeremy shaped dent in it. For those curious, I went with a Saatva Matress
