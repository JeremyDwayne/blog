## I live in Wisconsin, building software and flying airplanes.

I've been in tech for over 8 years, primarily working in Ruby on Rails. I'm currently focused on mastering Go and Typescript.

My expertise is in optimizing and scaling the backend services of distributed systems.
I'm passionate about building tools and processes that improve developer productivity and happiness.

✈️ When I'm not behind a desk you'll likely find me flying my 1963 Piper Cherokee 180
