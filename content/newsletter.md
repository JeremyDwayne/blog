Follow along my journey from a mid-level software engineer towards my goal of staff software engineer. 
This newsletter will be full of tips I find along the way, cool things on the internet I want to shout out, and will serve as a notification for new blog posts.

In addition to my programming related posts, I will be writing about my life and hobbies as well! I'm into cycling, aviation and reading.
