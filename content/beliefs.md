This is a collection of ideals I strive for and what it might look like to work with me.

- I will only work with good people with good intentions.
  - Treat others the way you want to be treated.
- I respect your time above my own.
  - Fewer meetings, more async messages.
  - Only respond to messages during work hours. If its urgent you can page them.
- Spending time elevating the skills or knowledge of peers is more valuable than focused individual work.
  - Measure team productivity rather than developer productivity.
  - I donâ€™t measure developer productivity by story points delivered.
- Workflow efficiency is incredibly important for long-term productivity and happiness.
  - Continual improvements to dev environment, CI/CD pipelines, procedures, etc.
- It's the manager's job to protect your time and to help unblock you with the business or other engineering teams.
- Progress over perfection otherwise you'll never accomplish anything.
- LeetCode challenges are not the best way to assess candidates. Technical interviews should feel like an actual pair programming session.
